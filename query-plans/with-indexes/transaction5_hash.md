# Query Text:
	* Which trains arrive the fullest?
	* â†’ Show all arriving trains for given station on a given day
	* with their occupancy rates
	* with highest occupancy first.
	*
	* SCRIPT PARAMS:
	* station: the end station for which this is shown, varchar
	* day: the date, date
	*
	* EXEC SCRIPT:
	* psql -v station="'STATION'" -v day="'2020-08-22'" railway-system < transactions/transaction5.sql
	*
	* TEST VALUES:
	psql -v station="'Weinsberg East'" [DB-NAME] < transactions/transaction5.sql
	
	* NOTE: We see as result= 0.00% due to of the huge number of seat in a seat => no, it was because of rounding of the division
